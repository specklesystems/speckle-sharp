// POC: probably NOT the right place, probably needs passing in with the send/rcv operation
// not clear how this should get configured or if we should have it, the shape probably needs to change
// this was dragged in because it (or something like it) is required for reference point conversion.
// have made it a strongly typed thing encapsulating a dictionary so as not to rely on injecting a weak type.
// relates to https://spockle.atlassian.net/browse/CNX-9357
