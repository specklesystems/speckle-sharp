// if you have a structure for organising things, your interfaces, then finding your stuff, your classes & methods, becomes easy
// having a lack of interfaces or large interfaces is a bit like lacking structure, when all of your stuff, your classes & methods
// clould be anywhere or all in once place - rooting through box 274 for something you need, when said box has a miriad different
// and unrelated items, is no fun. Plus when you need that item, you end up bringing out the whole box/
