## Introduction

This repo holds Speckle's Rhino Connector and it is currently released as âš  **ALPHA** âš , please use at your own risk!

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

#### ðŸ“š [Speckle Docs website](https://speckle.guide/dev/)

## Developing & Debugging

We encourage everyone interested to debug / hack /contribute / give feedback to this project.

### Requirements

- Rhino 6 or above (we're currently testing with 6.30)
- A Speckle Server running (more on this below)
- Speckle Manager (more on this below)

## Getting Started

The following instructions try to help you with getting started debugging and contributing to this connector.

#### Dependencies

In order to test Speckle in all its glory you'll need a server running, you can run a local one by simply following the [instructions in the server's readme](https://github.com/specklesystems/Server). The connector itself doesn't have features to manage your Speckle accounts, this functionality has been delegated to [the Speckle Manager desktop app](https://speckle-releases.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/manager/SpeckleManager%20Setup.exe). You can download it from [here](https://speckle-releases.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/manager/SpeckleManager%20Setup.exe). After installing it, you can use it to add/create an account on the Server.

### Debugging

After setting up dependencies, server and accounts you're good to go - almost there! After the first build, make sure to:

- Open the bin folder (e.g., `C:\Users\Admin\Code\sharp\ConnectorRhino\bin\Debug`),
- Drag and drop the `ConnectorRhino.rhp` inside an already running instance of Rhino,
- Open the Speckle plugin by typing `Speckle` in the Rhino command line.

You can now close Rhino, and start a Visual Studio's debug session. This will launch Rhino for you, and the Speckle plugin should load!
