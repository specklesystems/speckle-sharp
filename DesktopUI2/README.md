# DesktopUI v2

Cross-platform User Interface for all our .NET based connectors.
It uses [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) and [Material.Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaCommunity/Material.Avalonia).

For local debugging, set the start project to `DesktopUI2.Launcher` and hit debug.

NOTE: launching the UI outside a host applicaiton uses dummy bindings so no data is actually sent or received.
